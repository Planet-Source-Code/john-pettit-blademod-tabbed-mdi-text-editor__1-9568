BladeMod supports Drag & Drop! Simply drag any file(s) you wish to open onto the window.  BladeMod takes care of the rest!
You can see the status of the NumLock, CapsLock, ScrollLock & Insert Keys by watching the 'live' status bar.
To change a section of text's attributes - simply select the text and either select 'Format|Font...' from the menu or click on the 'Font' button on the toolbar.
The toolbar makes it easier to edit font attributes and sizes, as well as accessing common functions and options.
Changing the size of the font is even easier! Just use the font size selector on the toolbar.
BladeMod is PostCardWare. This means that you get a fully funtional, multi-talented, file editor by simply sending an email with ideas, suggestions, comments, postcards from where you are, etc. and recieving a password to unlock the application.
This program took quite a while to make test and debug.  You can show your appreciation by selecting the 'Help' menu and voting for 'BladeMod' on PlanetSourceCode.  Thanks for your interest in BladeMod :-)
